In this vid we will see
1. Understand app.js code.
2. Example of View, Text and Button.
3. Interview Question.



2. Example of View, Text and Button:
* To use View component we have to import it from RN.
    import {View} from 'react-native';

* You can use it like this:
    <View>
      // Your code will be here.
    </View>

* Similarly you can import and use Text and Button components as well.
    import {Text,Button} from 'react-native';
    <View>
      <Text style={{fontSize:20,textAlign:'center',marginTop:250}}>Hello World!</Text>
      <Button title='Press Here' ></Button>
    </View>



3. Interview Questions:
* What is the difference between "Html Tag" and "React Native Component"?
    Html Tag starts with "small latter"
    RN Component starts with "Capital Latter"

* Can we directly add any string inside the "View component"?
    No we can't. If we want to add a string inside the View component, then we need
    to use "Text component".

* Can we return multiple "Text component" or any components at directly?
    No we can't. We have to wrap them all inside a single component, then only we will 
    be able to return them.
