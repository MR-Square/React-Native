Inline Styling:
* It is same as styling in html.
* We add style attribute in opening tag.
* style = {{}}


Internal Styling:
* To use internal styling we import "StyleSheet" from 'react-native'.
* Then we create an object by using StyleSheet.create()
* For more details you can refer internal styling in "VidTwelve" component.


External Styling:
* We can create a folder inside our src folder to store our styling files.
* Then we can create styling file along with .js as its extension.
* e.g: style.js 
* Then same as internal styling we will import and create objects.
* Don't forget to export the object.
* For more details you can refer 'styles/style.js'


How can we add multiple classes?
* To add multiple classes use list.
* e.g: we want to use sty.textBox, ExternalStyle.textBox and {fontSize:20} for text widget.
* <Text style={[sty.textBox, ExternalStyle.textBox, {fontSize:20}]}>Multi Styling</Text>
