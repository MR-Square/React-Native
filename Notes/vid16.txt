List with map function(Custom)

In this vid:
1. Make an array of users.
2. Use map function to create list.
3. Apply style of list.
4. Need scroll view to scroll list.


* Why we use map function instead of using for/while loop?
    map function is able to return someting when it runs
    whereas for/while loops can not return anything.
    Therefore we use map function instead of them.

* Is list created by without using FlatList scrollable?
    No, it is not scrollable by default.
    We can make it scrollable by using "ScrollView" widget.

* How can use ScrollView widget?
    First we need to import it from reat-native.
    Then we have to write our list inside the ScrollView widget.
    Then our list will be scrollable.

* Which option is better: "List with map" or "List with FlatList"?
    If you have very less no of items(40-50) in your list, then both options are better.
    If you have a lots of items in your list, then second option is better.
    FlatList provides a lot of feature as well.
