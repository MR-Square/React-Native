Make Dynamic Grid

In this vid:

2. Add style to make the grid.
3. Make dynamic grid.

* How can we create a grid?
    To create a grid layout, we use flex property.

* Explain flex property.
    If you want to use flex property you can use it by using "flex" property.
    e.g: flex:1
    here 1 means flex item will get the entire space.
    flexDirection:'row',
    flexWrap:'wrap',
    justifyContent:'center',
    alignItems:'center'

* Explain "flex" property in detail.
    it accepts int value.
    flex: 1 means item will take entire space.
    let's take an example:
    <View>
      <View style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'red'}} />
      <View style={{flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'darkorange'}} />
      <View style={{flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'green'}} />
    </View>
    1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    In the above example first view(with backgroundColor as red) will take 1/6 of the space.
    darkorange view will take 2/6 of the space.
    green view will take 3/6 of the space.
